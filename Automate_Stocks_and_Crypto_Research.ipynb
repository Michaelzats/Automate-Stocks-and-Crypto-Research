Microsoft’s latest laptop isn’t going to knock your socks off in the performance department, especially compared to the likes of the mighty Surface Laptop Studio. But its new 11th-generation Intel (INTC) Core i5 chip should provide more than enough power for web browsing, streaming movies, and video chatting. Think of the Surface Laptop Go 2 as more of a Chromebook (GOOG, GOOGL) competitor than a rival to, say, Apple’s (AAPL) MacBook Air. Its 12.4-inch touchscreen PixelSense display is on the smaller side, but ensures that, combined with the laptop’s thin and light design, the Surface Laptop Go 2 will easily slide into your bag. Despite its $599 price tag, the Surface Laptop Go 2 comes complete with premium features including a fingerprint reader, Instant On, and an improved webcam and speakers. Perhaps the Surface Laptop Go 2’s most impressive features are its ability to replace and upgrade a number of its components. Microsoft says you’ll be able to replace the Surface Laptop Go 2’s shell, battery, and solid-state drive, helping to ensure you’ll be able to use the pint-size laptop well into the future. Of course, it would be better if you could easily replace all of the Surface Laptop Go 2’s components, including its processor, but that’s likely a bit too much to ask at this point. Plus, it means users wouldn’t have to upgrade their devices for years. The Surface Laptop Go 2 is coming to market at a time when overall PC shipments are seeing their first declines following two years of impressive growth powered by consumers and businesses snagging systems for both schools and work-from-home setups. According to IDC, global PC shipments declined',\n",

              "  \"After a leak yesterday spoiled the surprise, Microsoft has unveiled the Surface Laptop Go 2, a $600 starter laptop with premium looks. It looks very much like the original, has an near-identical 12.4-inch 1,536 x 1,024 touch display, anodized aluminum top and weight that's just a fraction more at 2.48 pounds. However, the new model is powered by an 11th-gen Intel Core i5 CPU with Iris Xe graphics, and runs Windows 11 instead of Windows 10. The 11th-gen Intel CPU should give the Surface Laptop Go 2 a much-needed speed boost. And storage options are now 128GB or 256GB — a step up from the previous model, which offered just 64GB of sluggish eMMC storage on the base $550 model. However, other aspects of the new model haven't changed. It still offers from 4GB to 8GB of LPDDR4x RAM (or 16GB for commercial customers), a relatively low-resolution screen, and no backlight on the keyboard. Battery life is up a touch from 13 to 13.5 hours under normal usage, good enough for a day's worth of computing. And you can charge it to 80 percent power in under an hour thanks to the 39-watt charger. Other features include WiFi 802.11ax, one USB-C port, one USB-A port, a 3.5mm headphone jack and a Surface Connect power port. The Surface Laptop Go 2 is still the cheapest Surface laptop, but we weren't completely sold on the original. Designed to take on Chromebooks, it offered more premium look for a bit more money. However, the mediocre performance made it a tough sell against rivals like the Dell XPS 13, which cost about the same in an 8GB configuration. Hopefully, the new model addresses those performance concerns — it's now available on pre-order at Microsoft.com or BestBuy.com starting at $600. BlackBerry Ltd. said Wednesday that it is free to explore other sale options for its patents after the prolonged transaction closing of the previously announced deal with Catapult IP Innovations. BlackBerry announced at the end of January that it would sell its legacy patents relating mostly to mobile devices to Maryland-based Catapult for $600 million.\",\n",

              "  'Microsoft stock slides after tech giant lowers earnings outlook By Nivedita Balu and Yuvraj Malik (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Thursday cut its fourth-quarter forecast for profit and revenue, making it the latest U.S. company to warn of a hit from a stronger greenback. A hawkish Federal Reserve and heightened geopolitical tensions have driven a 14% gain in the dollar against a basket of currencies over the last year, forcing companies such as Coca-Cola Co and Procter & Gamble to temper expectations for the rest of the year. A stronger greenback typically eats into the profits of companies that have sprawling international operations and convert foreign currencies into dollars. \"Software companies including Microsoft have significant operations outside the U.S. and I think Microsoft is being prudent here to get ahead of (market) expectations and be transparent around currency impacts,\" said Steve Koenig, managing director at SMBC Nikko Securities. Microsoft, which gets about half its revenue from outside the United States, lowered its revenue forecast for all three segments, which include Windows products, cloud services and personal computing. Corporate hedging activity has increased as more companies try to guard their profits against the impact of currency fluctuations amid surging inflation. It is common for companies to protect themselves from unexpected forex moves, but the urgency comes after years of muted forex volatility, during which currency fluctuations had limited impact on earnings.

All new hires must be approved by Executive Vice President Rajesh Jha and his leadership team, Jha told employees in an email Thursday, a Microsoft spokesperson said. Those groups have expanded recently and the company wants to make sure it’s making the right hires in the right places, the spokesperson said. The slowdown is not companywide, and overall the software maker will continue to hire, the spokesperson said, noting that such caution is typical in periods of economic volatility. “As Microsoft gets ready for the new fiscal year, it is making sure the right resources are aligned to the right opportunity,” the company said in a statement. “Microsoft will continue to grow headcount in the year ahead and it will add additional focus to where those resources go.” The company’s fiscal year starts July 1. Other big technology companies have been slowing or freezing hiring in the past several months as stocks plummet and fears of an economic recession escalate. Chipmaker Nvidia Corp. said Wednesday it expects to decelerate hiring in the second half of fiscal 2023, and companies such as Meta Platforms Inc., Snap Inc. and Salesforce Inc. have taken similar steps. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it will nearly double its budget for salary increases and boost stock grants in order to better retain key workers.

              "  'China-backed hackers are exploiting an unpatched Microsoft Office zero-day vulnerability, known as “Follina”, to execute malicious code remotely on Windows systems. The high-severity vulnerability -- tracked as CVE-2022-30190 -- is being used in attacks to execute malicious PowerShell commands via the Microsoft Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) when opening or previewing specially crafted Office documents. The flaw, which affects 41 Microsoft products, including Windows 11 and Office 365, works without elevated privileges, bypasses Windows Defender detection and does not need macro code to be enabled to execute binaries or scripts. The zero-day can also circumvent Microsoft’s Protected View feature, an Office tool that warns against potentially malicious files and documents. Huntress researchers warned that converting the document to a Rich Text Format (RTF) file could allow attackers to bypass this warning and also enables the exploit to be triggered with a hover-preview of a downloaded file that does not require any clicks.  Microsoft has warned that the flaw could enable threat actors to install programs, delete data and create new accounts in the context allowed by the user’s rights. Cybersecurity researchers observed hackers exploiting the flaw to target Russian and Belarussian users since April, and Enterprise security firm Proofpoint said this week that a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group has been exploiting the zero-day in attacks targeting the international Tibetan community. \"TA413 CN APT spotted [in-the-wild] exploiting the Follina zero-day using URLs to deliver ZIP archives which contain Word Documents that use the technique,\" Proofpoint said in a tweet. \"Campaigns impersonate the \\'Women Empowerments Desk\\' of the Central Tibetan Administration and use the domain tibet-gov.web[.]app\". Proofpoint tells TechCrunch that it has previously observed the TA413 threat actor -- also tracked as \"LuckyCat\" and \"Earth Berberoka\" -- targeting Tibetan organizations through the use of malicious browser extensions and COVID-19-themed espionage campaigns. The Follina zero-day was initially reported to Microsoft on April 12, after Word documents -- which pretended to be from Russia’s Sputnik news agency offering recipients a radio interview -- were found abusing the flaw in the wild. However, Shadow Chaser Group\\'s crazyman, the researcher who first reported the zero-day, said Microsoft',\n",

              " 'China-backed hackers are exploiting an unpatched Microsoft Office zero-day vulnerability, known as “Follina”, to execute malicious code remotely on Windows systems. The high-severity vulnerability -- tracked as CVE-2022-30190 -- is being used in attacks to execute malicious PowerShell commands via the Microsoft Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) when opening or previewing specially crafted Office documents. The flaw, which affects 41 Microsoft products, including Windows 11 and Office 365, works without elevated privileges, bypasses Windows Defender detection and does not need macro code to be enabled to execute binaries or scripts. The zero-day can also circumvent Microsoft’s Protected View feature, an Office tool that warns against potentially malicious files and documents. Huntress researchers warned that converting the document to a Rich Text Format (RTF) file could allow attackers to bypass this warning and also enables the exploit to be triggered with a hover-preview of a downloaded file that does not require any clicks.  Microsoft has warned that the flaw could enable threat actors to install programs, delete data and create new accounts in the context allowed by the user’s rights. Cybersecurity researchers observed hackers exploiting the flaw to target Russian and Belarussian users since April, and Enterprise security firm Proofpoint said this week that a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group has been exploiting the zero-day in attacks targeting the international Tibetan community. \"TA413 CN APT spotted [in-the-wild] exploiting the Follina zero-day using URLs to deliver ZIP archives which contain Word Documents that use the technique,\" Proofpoint said in a tweet. \"Campaigns impersonate the \\'Women Empowerments Desk\\' of the Central Tibetan Administration and use the domain tibet-gov.web[.]app\". Proofpoint tells TechCrunch that it has previously observed the TA413 threat actor -- also tracked as \"LuckyCat\" and \"Earth Berberoka\" -- targeting Tibetan organizations through the use of malicious browser extensions and COVID-19-themed espionage campaigns. The Follina zero-day was initially reported to Microsoft on April 12, after Word documents -- which pretended to be from Russia’s Sputnik news agency offering recipients a radio interview -- were found abusing the flaw in the wild. However, Shadow Chaser Group\\'s crazyman, the researcher who first reported the zero-day, said Microsoft',\n",
              " 'NEW YORK & REDMOND, Wash. & SEATTLE, June 02, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Accenture (NYSE: ACN) and Microsoft, together with their joint venture Avanade, are joining forces to tackle climate change, one of the most critical and urgent challenges for both businesses and people. With an immediate emphasis on delivering solutions to help organizations transform their operations, products, services and value chains to help accelerate the transition to net zero, the three companies will expand their focus to broader environmental, social and governance (ESG) challenges in the future. The companies are investing in the co-development of innovative solutions — architected and designed at the onset to emit less carbon over their life cycle — and offering advisory services to help businesses reduce carbon emissions, speed the transition to new energy sources, and shrink or even eliminate waste of finite resources such as water, food and raw materials. With the powerful combination of Accenture Sustainability Services, Avanade’s human-centered digital experience, the Microsoft Cloud and each company’s robust data and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, the expanded strategic partnership will address both horizontal and industry-specific sustainability challenges to help drive impact and deliver new value. \"Increasingly, as all stakeholders look to business to move from commitment to action on environmental challenges, companies that embed sustainability across their enterprises can become a powerful force for change,\" said Julie Sweet, chair and chief executive officer of Accenture. \"Our partnership with Microsoft and Avanade will help organizations find new value at the intersection of technology and sustainability – from embracing green software development principles and sustainable cloud migrations, to digital twin technology adoption – to drive stronger performance and competitiveness, and make progress on their decarbonization goals and their journey to net zero.\" \"Operating sustainably has become a source of competitive advantage, enabling organizations to increase efficiency, accelerate growth and lead with purpose,\" said Judson Althoff, executive vice president and chief commercial officer, Microsoft. \"By combining our expertise with Accenture and Avanade, we have an opportunity and responsibility to deliver innovative solutions that will empower organizations to achieve their sustainability goals and drive lasting environmental change.\" Through the expanded',\n",
              " \"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Thursday lowered its forecast for profit and revenue in the fourth quarter, citing a hit from unfavorable currency movements. The company cut the profit view to $2.24 to $2.32 per share, from a prior expectation of $2.28 to $2.35 per share. It now expects revenue between $51.94 billion and $52.74 billion, compared with its prior range of $52.40 billion to $53.20 billion. (Reporting by Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni) After exploding in the headlines back in March, Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock split is set for this Friday, and its share price has been climbing higher this week in anticipation.  The main reason to buy shares before the split is the likelihood that the share price will rise before and after the split.  Historically, stock splits have generated price increases. While stock splits tend to ramp up investor excitement, there are plenty of other reasons to buy shares in the Google parent. MarketWatch Picks has highlighted these products and services because we think readers will find them useful; the MarketWatch News staff is not involved in creating this content.  What’s more, if they’re telling you a 3% to 4% rate of return is what they can do, that’s because those lower returns are consistent with the goal of capital preservation rather than a growth-above-all-else strategy that would be needed to generate annual returns of 10% or more, says McBride. Ford issues a news release saying the auto maker has a big announcement planned for Thursday. Now we know what it is. Elon Musk is calling Tesla executives back to the office—and using factory workers’ demanding schedules to justify his orders.  The Tesla CEO sent out an email on May 31 entitled “Remote work is no longer acceptble (sic)” arguing for the company to succeed, executives needed to be back in Tesla’s main offices.  “Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla,” the electric-vehicle magnate wrote in the internal email\",\n",
